Build documentation
===================

To build the documentation, cd to `docs` (from the root folder of the project). You can then generate automatically the documentation from code comments:

.. code:: bash

   sh gen_doc.sh

And produce the html files:

.. code:: bash

   make html

All html file will be saved in `<root_folder>/docs/build/html`.
