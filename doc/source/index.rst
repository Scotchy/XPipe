Welcome to PipeML's documentation !
===================================

PipeML is a library that I started developping in December 2020 for my personal use.
As it might be useful for other people, I decided to publish the code as an open source project on Github.

PipeML focuses on three principal components to make Data Science easier:

- Configuration files
- Managing experiments
- A user friendly, clean and minimalistic GUI

It will enable you to easily navigate, organize and filter your experiments and to plot different kind of graphs.
The philosophy behind the project is to be simple and customizable.

You would particularly appreciate the library if you need to launch a lot of experiments and plot graphs from one or several of your results.

As a team, you can run a single PipeML server for everyone. Members of the team have their own account and can create a private/shared space in which they can store their experiments.
It will promote exchange as everyone can easily share their work with others.
